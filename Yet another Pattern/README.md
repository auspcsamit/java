Yet Another Pattern

Ninja was playing with her sister to solve a puzzle pattern. However, even after taking several hours, they could not solve the problem.

A value of N is given to them, and they are asked to solve the problem. Since they are stuck for a while, they ask you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?

Pattern Image

Explanation:

The value of ‘N’ is 3, so three rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“***”,”**”,”*”].
Example 2

Input:

2

Output:

Pattern Image

Explanation:

The value of ‘N’ is 2, so the two rows are to be printed from 1 to 2 where each row starts from 2, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“**”,”*”].
Constraints

1 <= N <= 300
