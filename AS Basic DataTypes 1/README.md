AS Basic DataTypes 1

Take user input of 3 integer numbers (x,y,z) to perform following operations using them.

    Op1 = x+y+z

    Op2 = x*y-z

Store the values of these operations in 2 different variables of integer type (Op1,Op2) and simply print them in the same order in separate lines.

Input Format

First line contains input of x, y, z separated by a space

Output Format

First line contains Op1

Second line contains Op2

Example 1

Input

2 3 4

Output

9
2

Explanation
Op1=2+3+4 = 9 & Op2= 2\*3-4=2

Example 2

Input

5 8 9

Output

21
31

Explanation

Op1=5+8+9 = 21 & Op2= 5\*8-9=31

Required Time Complexity: O(1)
