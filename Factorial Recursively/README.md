Given a positive integer N, find its factorial recursively.

Input Format

Input consists of a single line.

Input consists of a single integer N

Output Format

Print the factorial of the number.

Example 1

Input

5

Output

120

Explanation

We have N = 5.

So Factorial of 5 = 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 = 120

Example 2

Input

15

Output

1307674368000

Explanation

We have N = 15.

So Factorial of 15 = 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 _ 6 _ 7 _ 8 _ 9 _ 10 _ 11 _ 12 _ 13 _ 14 _ 15 = 1307674368000

Constraints

1 <= N <= 18
