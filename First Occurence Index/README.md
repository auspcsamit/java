First Occurence Index

You are given an array A of size N with possibly duplicate elements. Your task is to find the index of first occurence of an element T in the given array. Also, return -1 if the element is not present.

You have to complete firstIndex function which contains array A , integers T (target) and startIndex as inputs and returns the first index of occurence as integer output

Input Format

First line represents size of the array i.e. N

Second line represents n-spaced array elements of the array.

Third line represents element T for which we have to find the first index of occurence.

Output Format

Print the integer value i.e. first index of occurence of the element.

Example 1

Input

6
5 6 4 6 1 2
6

Output

1

Explanation

6 is present twice in the input array and the first time it appears is at index 1.

Example 2

Input

8
3 9 2 6 1 4 2 1
7

Output

-1

Explanation

7 is not present in the array so the output is -1.

Constraints

0 <= N <= 10^5

-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9

-10^9 <= T <= 10^9
