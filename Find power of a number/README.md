Ninja is sitting in an examination hall. He is encountered with a problem statement, "Find ‘X’ to the power ‘N’ (i.e. ‘X’ ^ ‘N’). Where ‘X’ and ‘N’ are two integers." Ninja was not prepared for this question at all, as this question was unexpected in the exam. He is asking for your help to solve this problem. Help Ninja to find the answer to the problem.

Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Input format: The first line of input contains two integers ‘X’ and ‘N’ (separated by space).

Output Format: The only line of output will contain a single integer which will be equal to X ^ N (i.e. X raise to the power N).

Example 1: Input: 5 2 Output: 25 Explanation: Given X = 5 and N = 2. So, 5 ^ 2 = 25. As 5 \* 5 = 25.

Example 2: Input: 9 3 Output: 729 Explanation: Given X = 9 and N = 3. So, 9 ^ 3 = 729. As 9 _ 9 _ 9 = 729.

Constraints: 0 <= X <= 10 0 <= N <= 10
