Given an array of N integers and an integer K, your task is to calculate the count of pairs whose sum is divisible by K.

Input Format

The first line of input contains two integers N and K.

The next line contains N space-separated integers depicting values of an array.

Output Format

Print the count of required pairs.

Example 1

Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Output

2

Explanation

Here , 2 pairs are possible whose sum is divisible by 3 i.e (1 3) and (3 5) are the required pairs

Example 2

Input

5 3
1 2 3 4 5

Output

4

Explanation

Here , 4 pairs are possible whose sum is divisible by 3 i.e (1 5), (1 2), (2 4), and (4 5) are the required pairs.

Constraints

1 < = N < = 10^5

1 < = A[i] <= 10^5

1 <= K <= 10^5
