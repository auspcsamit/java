Find The Median

The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median.

Input Format

The first line inputs integer n, size of array a.
The second line inputs n space-seperated integers, i.e., a[i].

Output

In a new line, print the median of the array.

Example 1

Input

7
0 1 2 4 6 5 3

Output

3

Explanation The sorted a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6].
Its middle element is at a[3]=3.

Example 2

Input

5
10 12 11 14 -100

Output

11

Explanation The sorted a=[-100,10,11,12,14].
Its middle element is at a[2]=11.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000001
n is odd
-10000 <= a[i] <= 10000
