Greatest Common Divisor

Given 2 non negative integers m and n. Your task is to find the greatest common divisor of m and n.

GCD of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both m and n.Both m and n fit in a 32 bit signed integer.

Note : Do not use library function

You have to complete gcd function which contains two integer inputs and return integer answer as output

Input Format

First Line contains two integer m and n separated by space.

Output Format

Print the maximum valued integer g which satisfies the above properties.
