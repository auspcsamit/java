Print Character Pattern 2

Given an integer n that denotes the number of rows to be printed, print the pattern in which each row starts with its corresponding alphabet and has a length equal to the row number. (See the examples for a better understanding).

Note: You can take the alphabet to be cyclic. On reaching Z, you will cycle back to A, then B, and so on.
