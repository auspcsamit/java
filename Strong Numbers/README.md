Strong Numbers

You are given two numbers a and b. You have to calculate and print all the Strong Numbers between a and b (both inclusive). If no Strong number is present in the range a to b, then print nothing.

A Strong Number is a number whose sum of factorial of all digits is equal to the number itself. Like in the number 145, 1! + 4! + 5! == 145. So 145 is a Strong Number.

Similarly for 25, 2! + 5! = 122 so 25 isnt a Strong Number.
