Diagonal Difference!

Given a square matrix of size N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .

Each of the next N lines describes a row, and consists of N space-separated integers .

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of the matrix as a single integer.

Example 1

Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Output

15

Explanation:-

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 + (- 12) = 4

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19

Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Example 2

Input

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9

Output

2

Explanation:- The left-to-right diagonal sum =1+5+9=15 .

The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9 = 17.

Their absolute difference is |15-17| = 2.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^3

-10^3 <= mat[i][j] <=10^3

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x (|x| is always non negative for all x)
